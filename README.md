![logo](http://github.com/terra/zaz-fry/wiki/_img/logo.jpg)  

Fry is a web service engine we're building at Terra.  
Our main goal with _Fry_ is build a tool that FrontEnd engineers can use to automate theirs internal services.  
Also, Fry aims to be simple and modular, so you can create nothing but node modules for your custom services.
